                    After working for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Animal Welfare for so many years, I finally came back from to the Aquarium Hobby! I&apos;ve always been into Aquariums and Fishes, specially some Predatory ones. A big part of the money made, is gonna go into Wildlife Rescues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope I&apos;ll be able to get you the best possible Fishes/Things in the best possible prices!
                    if something goes South, kindly don&apos;t loose Hope in me; will sort out your things for sure

                    <p>From childhood, I have been observing the utmost cruelty on Reptiles, where there were no such teams for their Rescue or Rehabilitation. Figuring out the handling skills myself,
                        my Wildlife Conservation started. After Volunteering in several NGOs, got my NGO registered & I started making up the Team, which could make a difference in the Urban Wildlife Conservation.
                        Fishes used to be a big source of Peace since then, and to generate my pocket money when I was small, I used to breed several Cichlids & setups. Which extended to the level where I was raising several Raptors and other Wild Animals.</p>
                    <p>  I have always been crazy about Predatory fishes, specially the Channa family. Arowanas were not so common back then, but Iâ€™ve had a few, and that too for many years. Understanding the comfort & stress of the Fish, I never send fishes who have been transported lately Instead, I wait for their Stability and colour to come up. It usually takes about 3-4 weeks for any fish to come at the perfect condition.</p>

                <p>Apart from the Rescues & the welfare: Exotic Pet keeping hobby is always a part of me, but since the Rules & Laws are still very much complicated. Still you will be able to find some very cool Lobsters, Newts, Crabs, etc. here.
                    I hope all of my experience till now, is gonna help me making this hobby great. I hope you get the Fish of your Dreams!
